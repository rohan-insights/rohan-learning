INTRODUCTION: DSA [Data Structures & Algorithms] 

> Data Structures is about how data can be stored in different structures.
> Algorithms is about how to solve different problems, often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
> Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

Q. What are Data Structures?
-> A data structure is a way to store data.
We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and what we want to do with it.
First, let's consider an example without computers in mind, just to get the idea.
If we want to store data about people we are related to, we use a family tree as the data structure. 
We choose a family tree as the data structure because we have information about people we are related to and how they are related, and we want an overview so that we can easily find a specific family member, several generations back.
With such a family tree data structure visually in front of you, it is easy to see, for example, who my mother's mother is—it is 'Emma,' right? But without the links from child to parents that this data structure provides, it would be difficult to determine how the individuals are related.
Data structures give us the possibility to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services.
Data structures are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms. They help in managing and organizing data, reduce complexity, and increase efficiency.

# In Computer Science there are two different kinds of data structures.
> Primitive Data Structures are basic data structures provided by prog#ramming languages to represent single values, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and booleans.
> Abstract Data Structures are higher-level data structures that are built using primitive data types and provide more complex and specialized operations. Some common examples of abstract data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

Q. What are Algorithms?
-> An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem or achieve a specific goal.
A cooking recipe written on a piece of paper is an example of an algorithm, where the goal is to make a certain dinner. The steps needed to make a specific dinner are described exactly.
When we talk about algorithms in Computer Science, the step-by-step instructions are written in a programming language, and instead of food ingredients, an algorithm uses data structures.
Algorithms are fundamental to computer programming as they provide step-by-step instructions for executing tasks. An efficient algorithm can help us to find the solution we are looking for, and to transform a slow program into a faster one.
By studying algorithms, developers can write better programs.

Algorithm examples:
Finding the fastest route in a GPS navigation system
Navigating an airplane or a car (cruise control)
Finding what users search for (search engine)
Sorting, for example sorting movies by rating
The algorithms we will look at in this tutorial are designed to solve specific problems, and are often made to work on specific data structures. For example, the 'Bubble Sort' algorithm is designed to sort values, and is made to work on arrays.

# Data Structures together with Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms (DSA) go hand in hand. A data structure is not worth much if you cannot search through it or manipulate it efficiently using algorithms, and the algorithms in this tutorial are not worth much without a data structure to work on.
DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, and to solve specific problems.
By understanding DSA, you can:
Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation.
Make programs that run faster or use less memory.
Understand how to approach complex problems and solve them in a systematic way.

# Where is Data Structures and Algorithms Needed?
> Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are used in virtually every software system, from operating systems to web applications:
> For managing large amounts of data, such as in a social network or a search engine.
> For scheduling tasks, to decide which task a computer should do first.
> For planning routes, like in a GPS system to find the shortest path from A to B.
> For optimizing processes, such as arranging tasks so they can be completed as quickly as possible.
> For solving complex problems: From finding the best way to pack a truck to making a computer 'learn' from data.

# DSA is fundamental in nearly every part of the software world:
> Operating Systems
> Database Systems
> Web Applications
> Machine Learning
> Video Games
> Cryptographic Systems
> Data Analysis
> Search Engines

# Theory and Terminology
As we go along in this tutorial, new theoretical concepts and terminology (new words) will be needed so that we can better understand the data structures and algorithms we will be working on.
These new words and concepts will be introduced and explained properly when they are needed, but here is a list of some key terms, just to get an overview of what is coming:

Term	                                            Description

Algorithm	            -          A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.
Data Structure	      -          A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.
Time Complexity	      -          A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
Space Complexity	    -          A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
Big O Notation	      -          A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. Used in this tutorial to describe the time complexity of an algorithm.
Recursion	            -          A programming technique where a function calls itself.
Divide and Conquer	  -          A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions. Recursion is often used when using this method in an algorithm.
Brute Force	          -          A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.


A Simple Algorithm

# Fibonacci Numbers

The Fibonacci numbers are very usefule for introducing algorithms, so before we continue, here is a short introduction to fabonacci numbers.
The Fibonacci numbers are named after a 13th century Italian mathematician known as Fibonacci.
The two first Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1, and the next Fibonacci number is always the sum of the two previous numbers, so we get 0,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...
This tutorial will use loop and recursion a lot. so before we continue, let's implement three different versions of the algorithm to create Fibonacci numbers, just to see the difference between programming with loops and programming with recursion in a simple way.

# The Fibonacci Number Algorithm

To generate a Fibonacci number, all we need to do is to add the two previous Fibonacci numbers.
The Fibonacci numbers is a good way of demonstrating what an algorithm is.
We know the principle of how to find the next number, so we can write an algorithm to create as many Fibonacci numbers as possible.

> Below is the algorithm to create the 20 first Fibonacci numbers:

How it works:
  1. Start with the two first Fibonacci numbers 0 and 1.
    a. Add the two previous numbers together to create a new Fibonacci number.
    b. Update the value of the two previous numbers.
  2. Do point a and b above 18 times.

# Loop vs Recursion
To show the difference between loops and recursion, we will implement solutions to find Fibonacci numbers in three different ways:

1. An implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm above using a for loop.
2. An implementation of the Fibonacci algorithm above using recursion.
3. Finding the n th Fibonacci number using recursion.


1. Implementation Using a For Loop
It can be a good idea to list what the code must contain or do before programming it:

> Two variables to hold the previous two Fibonacci numbers
> A for loop that runs 18 times
> Create new Fibonacci numbers by adding the two previous ones
> Print the new Fibonacci number
> Update the variables that hold the previous two fibonacci numbers

Using the list above, it is easier to write the program: 


2. Implementation Using Recursion
Recursion is when a function calls itself.

To implement the Fibonacci algorithm we need most of the same things as in the code example above, but we need to replace the for loop with recursion.

To replace the for loop with recursion, we need to encapsulate much of the code in a function, and we need the function to call itself to create a new Fibonacci number as long as the produced number of Fibonacci numbers is below, or equal to, 19.


3. Finding The 
n
th Fibonacci Number Using Recursion
To find the n th Fibonacci number we can write code based on the mathematic formula for Fibonacci number n:
F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

This just means that for example the 10th Fibonacci number is the sum of the 9th and 8th Fibonacci numbers.

Note: This formula uses a 0-based index. This means that to generate the 20th Fibonacci number, we must write F(19).

When using this concept with recursion, we can let the function call itself as long as n is less than, or equal to, 1. 
If n ≤ 1 it means that the code execution has reached one of the first two Fibonacci numbers 1 or 0.
